echo "Once upon a time in a far off land called Charlottesville, there was a girl who loved to $NOUN1. Every day, she woke up, ate her $NOUN2 for breakfast, and went off to her niche and $ADJECTIVE3 hobby. While others thought she was $ADJECTIVE4, she didn't care. She loved it anyways. She always rode her $ANIMAL5 wherever she went, and carried around a $COLOR6 $ACCESSORY7. She taught me and  everyone around her to not care what others think, because her life kept her happy and $ADJECTIVE8."
